# Hate-To-Wait Airline Exploratory Data Analysis
A Galvanize Capstone Project by Justin Turner that uses Python, Statistics and Machine Learning to explore the departure punctuality of Airlines within the United States.

## Project Focus
  * Gather Information about historical flight data within the United States.
  * Perform Hypothesis Tests to gain insights

## Motivation
  * I am interested in providing travelers a tool to check which airline is the least likely to leave them waiting at the airport depending on where they are flying out from.
  * I have experienced long wait times this past year of travel due to controllable factors such as poor planning and aircraft maitance. 
  * Time is one's most precious asset.
